  <p> <em><strong>Version 1.9.4</strong></em> 
  </p>
  <p>Hi!</p>
  <p>
    The plugin's admin interface contains inline information, which most of the time should be sufficient for understanding how to use the plugin. However, many details are not covered there, but you can find them covered in this guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because an image is worth a thousand words, you might find these video tutorials useful:

  <h3 id="panels">1.1. Panels</h3>
  <p>
    You can manually specify the images and text in an accordion, or you can let the accordion to automatically load content (e.g., featured image, post title, excerpt, etc.) from any post type. Two other possibilities provided by the accordion is to load photos from Flickr or to load images from a post's
    <i>[gallery]</i>
    shortcode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, you can have panels with different content types in the same accordion. The content type can be set in the panel's
    <i>Settings</i>
    window, or you can directly create a panel with a specific content type from the
    <i>Add Panel</i>
    button. More about each panel type, later in this chapter.
  </p>

  <h4 id="panel-editors">Panel editors</h4>

  <p>
    You can see four buttons on each panel. These are for: adding a background image, adding layers, adding HTML content or changing the panel's content type.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/panel-buttons.png">
    <img src="assets/images/panel-buttons.png"></a>
  <p>
    If you click on each of these buttons, a certain modal window will be opened, that allow you to make the respective edits.
  </p>

  <h5 id="background-image-editor">Background image editor</h5>
  <a href="assets/images/background-editor.png">
    <img src="assets/images/background-editor.png"></a>
  <p>
    It consists of 3 sections: the
    <i>Background Image</i>
    section, which allows you to set the panel's main background image, the
    <i>Opened Background Image</i>
    section, which allows you to set the a background image that will only be visible when the panel is opened, and the
    <i>Link</i>
    section, which allows you to set a link for the background image.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> <strong>Note:</strong>
    When you select an image from the WordPress Media Library, also select the most appropriate size for it in the Media Library's right sidebar, under
    <i>ATTACHMENT DISPLAY SETTINGS</i>
    . You will want to select an image size that is similar to the panel size.
  </p>

  <h5 id="layers-editor">Layers editor</h5>
  <a href="assets/images/layers-editor.png">
    <img src="assets/images/layers-editor.png"></a>
  <p>
    It allows you to add static or animated layers. You can select from several layer types: paragraph layers, which allow you to add simple text paragraphs, heading layers, which allow you to add headings (e.g., H1, H2, H5, etc.), image layers, for adding images, video layers for adding several supported video types, and DIV layers, for any other HTML content.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you add a layer, a group of settings will appear for that layer, allowing you to set the layer's position, size, animation effects and more. The name of the settings are intuitive and there's also inline information for those settings that have more complex roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's possible to set the depth of the layers by sorting them in the list of layers from the left side.
  </p>

  <h5 id="html-editor">HTML editor</h5>
  <a href="assets/images/html-editor.png">
    <img src="assets/images/html-editor.png"></a>
  <p>It allows you to add any HTML content.</p>

  <h5 id="settings-editor">Settings editor</h5>
  <a href="assets/images/settings-editor.png">
    <img src="assets/images/settings-editor.png"></a>
  <p>
    It allows you to change the panel's content type. By default, the
    <i>Content Type</i>
    setting is set to
    <i>Custom Content</i>
    , which allows you to manually set the panel's background image and all the other content. The
    <i>Content from Posts</i>
    option will enable the panel to load featured images and other content from posts, the
    <i>Images from Post's gallery</i>
    option will fetch images added through a [gallery] shortcode, and
    <i>Flickr images</i>
    will load images from Flickr.
  </p>

  <h4 id="panel-types">Panel Types</h4>
  <p>
    The plugin tries to make it as easy as possible for you to add content, so it offers a direct way to create a certain panel type, populating it with some specific data from the start. All you have to do is hover the
    <i>Add Panel</i>
    button and click on the panel type that you want to create.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-panel-button.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-panel-button.png"></a>

  <h5 id="empty-panels">Empty Panels</h5>
  <p>
    This will create an empty panel, with no preset content or settings. After the panel was added, you can set a background image for it, html content, add layers, or even change its content type to something else.
  </p>

  <h5 id="image-panels">Image Panels</h5>
  <p>
    To add image panels, hover the
    <i>Add Panels</i>
    button and select
    <i>Image panels</i>
    . The WordPress Media Loader will be opened, where you can select a single image or multiple images (by holding the CTRL key on PC and Cmd key on Mac).
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    When you select an image, also select the most appropriate size for it in the Media Library's right sidebar, under
    <i>ATTACHMENT DISPLAY SETTINGS</i>
    . You will want to select an image size that is similar to the panel size.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you select the images, click on the
    <i>Insert into post</i>
    button, and one panel for each selected image will be added in the accordion.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-image-panels.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-image-panels.png"></a>

  <h5 id="posts-panels">Posts Panels</h5>
  <p>
    This will add a single panel in the admin interface, but this single panel will dynamically generate multiple panels in the published accordion, based on the set parameters.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-posts-panels.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-posts-panels.png"></a>
  <p>
    When you select this panel type the
    <i>Content Type</i>
    setting in the panel's
    <i>Settings</i>
    window will automatically be set to
    <i>Content from posts</i>
    . Also, in the Background editor, some fields will be automatically populated with data. For example, the
    <i>[ga_image_src]</i>
    will be added in the background's
    <i>Source</i>
    field and
    <i>[ga_link_url]</i>
    in the link's
    <i>URL</i>
    field.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-posts-panels-2.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-posts-panels-2.png"></a>
  <p>
    <i>[ga_image_src]</i>
    and
    <i>[ga_link_url]</i>
    are dynamic tags and are used for fetching a specific data from the posts that were loaded. You can also use these tags in the Layers and HTML editors. Each of these editors have, in their inline info, a list of the dynamic tags that can be used inside that specific editor.
  </p>
  <p>This is the complete list of dynamic tags for Posts panels:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tag</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image]</td>
      <td>
        The post's featured image, as an img HTML element. It accepts an optional parameter to specify the size of the image: [ga_image.thumbnail]. Accepted sizes are: full, large, medium, thumbnail. The default value is full.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image_src]</td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h5 id="gallery-panels">Gallery Panels</h5>
  <p>
    This will add a single panel in the admin interface, but this single panel will dynamically generate multiple panels in the published accordion, one panel for each image from the
    <i>[gallery]</i>
    shortcode.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-gallery-panels.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-gallery-panels.png"></a>
  <p>
    You just need to drop the grid accordion shortcode in a post that contains a
    <i>[gallery]</i>
    shortcode, and the images from the
    <i>[gallery]</i>
    will automatically be loaded in the accordion. Then, if you want to hide the original gallery, you can add the
    <i>hide</i>
    attribute to the
    <i>[gallery]</i>
    shortcode:
    <i>[gallery ids="1,2,3" hide="true"]</i>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the complete list of dynamic tags for Gallery panels:
  </p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tag</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image]</td>
      <td>
        The gallery image, as an img HTML element. It accepts an optional parameter to specify the size of the image: [ga_image.thumbnail]. Accepted sizes are: full, large, medium, thumbnail. The default value is full.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image_src]</td>
      <td>
        The URL of the gallery image. It accepts an optional parameter to specify the size of the image: [ga_image_src.thumbnail]. Accepted sizes are: full, large, medium, thumbnail. The default value is full.

      <td>The title of the gallery image</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image_description]</td>
      <td>The description of the gallery image.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h5 id="flickr-panels">Flickr Panels</h5>
  <p>
    This will add a single panel in the admin interface, but this single panel will dynamically generate multiple panels in the published accordion, one panel for each image loaded from Flickr.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/add-flickr-panels.png">
    <img src="assets/images/add-flickr-panels.png"></a>
  <p>
    First, you need to request an API key from Flickr and then specify it in the
    <i>API Key</i>
    field, in the Settings modal window.
  </p>
  <p>This is the complete list of dynamic tags for Flickr panels:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tag</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

      <td>
        The Flickr image, as an img HTML element. It accepts an optional parameter to specify the size of the image: [ga_image.thumbnail]. Accepted sizes are: full, large, medium, thumbnail. The default value is full.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_image_src]</td>
      <td>
        The URL of the Flickr image. It accepts an optional parameter to specify the size of the image: [ga_image_src.thumbnail]. Accepted sizes are: square, thumbnail, small, medium, medium_640, large. The default value is medium.
      </td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_username]</td>
      <td>The username of the image's owner.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[ga_user_link]</td>
      <td>The link to the profile of the image's owner.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3 id="general-settings">1.2. General settings</h3>
  <p>
    The accordion's general settings can be found in the sidebar of the accordion's admin interface. The description of each setting can be seen if you hover the setting's label.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/general-settings.png">
    <img src="assets/images/general-settings.png"></a>
  <p>
    The last panel in the sidebar is for breakpoints. Breakpoints allow you to modify the look of the accordion for different window sizes. Each breakpoint allows you to set the width of the window for which the breakpoint will apply, and then add several settings which will override the general settings.
  </p>

  <h3 id="publishing-the-accordion">1.3. Publishing the accordion</h3>
  <p>
    The accordion can be published in posts and pages, in widgets, and also in PHP code.
  </p>
  <p>
    In posts and pages you can use the Gutenberg block, which will allow you to select which accordion instance to insert from a list of created accordions. Alternatively, you can use the shortcode provided in the
    <i>Grid Accordion -> All Accordions</i>
    page, like this:
    <pre>[grid_accordion id="3"]</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    In PHP code, you need to use the
    <code>do_shortcode()</code>
    call and provide the actual shortcode as an argument, like this:
    <pre>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode( '[grid_accordion id="3"]' ); ?&gt;</pre>
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    When you add the accordion in PHP code, the plugin won't be able to detect the presence of the accordion there so it won't be able to automatically load the necessary CSS files. Because of this, you need to go to the
    <i>Grid Accordion -> Plugin Settings</i>
    page and set the
    <i>Load stylesheets</i>
    setting to
    <i>On homepage</i>
    if you load the accordion on the homepage or to
    <i>On all pages</i>
    if you load the accordion in other pages.
  </p>
  <h3 id="previewing-the-accordion">1.4. Previewing the accordion</h3>
  <p>
    The accordions can be previewed directly in the admin area, and you don't have to create or update the accordion before previewing the edits you make to the panels or to the general settings.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cache">1.5. Cache</h3>
  <p>
    All accordions are automatically cached the first time when they're viewed by a visitor, so next time when someone visits the page, the accordion will be served from the cache. This mechanism saves processing time and is especially useful when loading content from posts or external services.
  </p>
  <p>
    When an accordion is updated in the admin area, the cached version of the accordion will be deleted. Also, you can deleted all cached accordions from within the
    <i>Grid Accordion -> Plugin Settings</i>
    page, by clicking on the
    <i>Clear all cache now</i>
    button.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to not cache an accordion, you can set the
    <i>allow_cache</i>
    attribute to
    <i>false</i>
    , in the shortcode:
  </p>
  <pre>[grid_accordion id="3" allow_cache="false"]</pre>

  <h2 id="responsiveness">2. Responsiveness</h2>
  <h3 id="responsive-modes">2.1. Responsive modes</h3>
  <p>
    By default, the accordion will scale proportionally in order to fit the bounds of the window or of the container it was added to. This is called
    <i>Auto</i>
    responsiveness, and it's useful when you don't have CSS knowledge, to be able to customize the responsive behavior yourself. In this responsive mode, the accordion will resize everything in it, like layers or HTML content, proportionally.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have CSS knowledge, it's recommended to use
    <i>Custom</i>
    responsiveness, by setting the
    <i>Responsive Mode</i>
    setting to
    <i>Custom</i>
    and then use CSS media queries to define different text sizes or to hide certain elements when the accordion becomes smaller, ensuring that all content remains readable without having to zoom in.
  </p>
  <p>
    In both cases, the Width and Height settings can be set to fixed values, not necessarily percentage values, as the accordion will still scale down and properly. Also, the Width and Height will represent the maximum width and height that the accordion will have.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use
    <i>Auto</i>
    responsiveness, the Width and Height need to be set to fixed values. Setting them to percentages would not allow the accordion to properly calculate how it needs to resize itself.
  </p>

  <h3 id="aspect-ratio">2.2. Aspect ratio</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to set the Width and/or Height to a percentage value, like 100%, the accordion will not be able to calculate the aspect ratio that it needs to maintain while it's being resized (as it does when the Width and Height are set to fixed values). For example, if the Width is set to 960 and the Height is set to 400, that results in an aspect ratio of 2.4 (960/400). However, as you can guess, if either the Width or Height is a percentage, the division operation can't be done. To overcome this, you need to use the
    <i>Aspect Ratio</i>
    setting, for manually setting the aspect ratio that the accordion needs to maintain while it's resizing.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default,
    <i>Aspect Ratio</i>
    is set to -1, which indicates that the aspect ratio of the accordion will be automatically calculated based on the Width and Height specified.
  </p>

  <h2 id="custom-css-and-javascript">3. Custom CSS and JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes you want to change the look of the accordion or add new functionality, and for this you can use the "Custom CSS and JS" premium add-on, which is optimized to load the custom code only on pages where there are published accordions. The add-on also features syntax highlighting code editors and a revisions system that will save all code edits and allow you to compare and restore revisions.
  </p>

  <h3 id="custom-css">3.1. Custom CSS</h3>
  <p>
    Before adding any custom CSS, it's recommended to give the accordion that you want to target a custom class. This can be set in the
    <i>Custom Class</i>
    field, in the accordion's
    <i>Appearance</i>
    sidebar panel.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    The custom class name you specify in the
    <i>Custom Class</i>
    field doesn't need to include the dot, only the name of the class. For example, you need to enter
    <i>my-accordion</i>
    , not
    <i>.my-accordion</i>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    After you assigned a custom class to the accordion, you can use it in the
    <i>Custom CSS</i>
    field, to target that specific accordion.
  </p>
  <p>
    You could use a general selector, like
    <i>.grid-accordion</i>
    if you want to target all your accordion instances.
  </p>

  <h3 id="custom-javascript">3.2. Custom JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
    Just like with custom CSS, you need to assign a custom class to the accordion and then use it in your custom code to target that specific accordion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next chapter offers a presentation of the accordion's JavaScript API, which allows you to programatically control the accordion. Using this API requires some programming knowledge and familiarity with jQuery.
  </p>

  <h3 id="javascript-api">3.3 JavaScript API</h3>

  <h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
  <p>
    The public methods below allow you to manipulate the accordion using external controls. There are two ways of calling a public method.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first way is by calling the
    <code>gridAccordion</code>
    plugin and passing the name of the method and additional arguments:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$( '.my-accordion' ).gridAccordion( 'openPanel', 3 );</code></pre>

  <p>
    The first argument represents the name of the method and the second argument represents the value which will be applied. Please note that some methods don't have a second argument. For example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$( '.my-accordion' ).gridAccordion( 'nextPanel' );</code></pre>

  <p>
    The second way is by getting a reference to the GridAccordion instance and calling the method on the instance:
  </p>
  <pre><code>// get a reference to the GridAccordion instance
var accordion = $( '.my-accordion' ).data( 'gridAccordion' );

console.log( accordion.getTotalPanels() );

accordion.gotoPage( 2 );
</code></pre>

  <p>
    This way of calling a public method is mandatory when you use public methods that return data:
    <code>getPanelAt</code>
    ,
    <code>getCurrentIndex</code>
    ,
    <code>getTotalPanels</code>
    ,
    <code>getVisiblePanels</code>
    ,
    <code>getTotalPages</code>
    and
    <code>getCurrentPage</code>
    , but it can be used with all the other public methods as well.
  </p>
  <p>Here is the list of available methods:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="190">Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>getPanelAt( index )</td>
      <td>
        Gets all the data of the panel at the specified index. Returns an object that contains all the data specified for that panel.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>getCurrentIndex()</td>
      <td>Gets the index of the current panel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>getTotalPanels()</td>
      <td>Gets the total number of panels.</td>
    </tr>

  <h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>
  <p>
    Callbacks (or events) are used to detect when certain actions take place. The callbacks can be added when the accordion is instantiated, or at a later time.
  </p>
  <p> <em>Examples:</em>
  </p>
  <pre><code>
$( '.my-accordion' ).on( 'panelOpen', function( event ) {
    console.log( event.index );
})
</code></pre>

  <p>
    As you can notice, the callback functions have an
    <i>event</i>
    parameter which contains some information about that event.
  </p>
  <p>The list of available events:</p>

  <h2 id="import-and-export-accordions">4. Import and export accordions</h2>

  <p>
    You can move accordions between
    <i>Grid Accordion</i>
    installations by exporting and then importing them. Accordions can be exported by clicking on the
    <i>Export</i>
    link in the
    <i>Grid Accordion -> All Accordions</i>
    page. The exported text is a JSON-encoded representation of the accordion's data.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/export-accordion.png">
    <img src="assets/images/export-accordion.png"></a>
  <p>
    To import an accordion, you need to click on the
    <i>Import Accordion</i>
    button in the
    <i>Grid Accordion -> All Accordions</i>
    page and, inside the modal window, copy the exported text.
  </p>
  <p>
    The examples showcased on the accordion's presentation page can be found in the
    <i>examples</i>
    folder included in the package downloaded from CodeCanyon, and I recommend importing them into your own
    <i>Grid Accordion</i>
    installation to see how certain featured are used.
  </p>

  <h2 id="advanced-shortcode-use">5. Advanced shortcode use</h2>

  <p>
    Not only you can insert accordions into pages using shortcodes, but you can also override settings, add or modify panels. It's even possible to create an accordion using only shortcodes, without setting it up in the admin area.
  </p>
  <p>You can override the accordion's settings like this:</p>
  <pre>
[grid_accordion id="1" width="700" aspect_ratio="2" visible_panels="5"]
</pre>
  <p>
    As you can notice, the name of the settings are the same as those in the admin area, but they are lower case and with an underscore between words. This applies for all settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to add breakpoint settings in the shortcode, you need to add them in a JSON-encoded string, since the
    <i>breakpoints</i>
    setting accepts an associated array-like value. You can create some breakpoints in the admin area and then see how the JavaScript code generated looks like.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned before, you can add new panels or change the data of existing ones:
  </p>

  <pre>
[grid_accordion id="1" width="700" aspect_ratio="2" visible_panels="5"]
    [grid_accordion_panel index="1"]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_source"]path/to/new_image.jpg[/grid_accordion_panel_element]
    [/grid_accordion_panel]
    [grid_accordion_panel]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_source"]path/to/image.jpg[/grid_accordion_panel_element]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="opened_background_source"]path/to/opened_image.jpg[/grid_accordion_panel_element]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_link"]https://bqworks.net/grid-accordion/[/grid_accordion_panel_element]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="layer" horizontal="center" show_transition="right"]some layer content[/grid_accordion_panel_element]
    [/grid_accordion_panel]
[/grid_accordion]
</pre>

  <p>
    The first
    <i>grid_accordion_panel</i>
    shortcode will override the first panel in the accordion As you can notice that it has the
    <i>index</i>
    attribute specified and set to 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second
    <i>grid_accordion_panel</i>
    shortcode doesn't have an index, so this will be a new panel element added after the panels created in the accordion's admin area.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the list of available types for
    <i>grid_accordion_panel_element</i>
    shortcodes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>background_source</li>
    <li>background_alt</li>
    <li>background_title</li>
    <li>background_retina_source</li>
    <li>opened_background_source</li>
    <li>opened_background_alt</li>
    <li>opened_background_title</li>
    <li>opened_background_retina_source</li>
    <li>background_link</li>
    <li>background_link_title</li>
    <li>layer</li>
    <li>html</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you create an accordion from scratch using only shortcodes, you need to assign it a unique
    <i>id</i>
    attribute that doesn't already exist in the admin area.
  </p>
  <pre>
[grid_accordion id="99" width="960" height="400" responsive_mode="custom" visible_panels="5"]
    [grid_accordion_panel content_type="posts" posts_post_types="post,page" posts_taxonomies="tag|design;tag|development;tag|planning"]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_source"][ga_image_src][/grid_accordion_panel_element]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_alt"][ga_image_alt][/grid_accordion_panel_element]
        [grid_accordion_panel_element name="background_link"][ga_link_url][/grid_accordion_panel_element]
    [/grid_accordion_panel]
[/grid_accordion]
</pre>

  <p>
    The accordion above contains a panel that will load data from posts. The dynamic tags, like [ga_image_src] were discussed in previous chapter. As for the attributes added to the
    <i>grid_accordion_panel</i>
    shortcode, those are the equivalent of the settings from the panel's
    <i>Settings</i>
    modal window in the admin area.
  </p>
  <p>Below is a list of all the available panel settings:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

  // if the 'my_arg' argument is present, do something
  if ( $tag_arg !== false && $tag_arg === 'my_arg' ) {
    // do something
  }

  return $result;

  </pre>

  <h2 id="deep-linking">7. Deep Linking</h2>
  <p>
    Deep linking provides the possibility to link to a specific panel in the accordion. For this, you need to append a hashtag to the original URL of the page. The hashtag will contain the
    <i>id</i>
    attribute of the accordion and the
    <i>index</i>
    of the panel, separated by a slash (/) character.
  </p>
  <i>Example:</i>
  <pre>http://domain.com/page#grid-accordion-3/0</pre>
  <p>
    The link above will open the first panel (because panel indexes start with 0) in the accordion that has the
    <i>id</i>
    set to
    <i>grid-accordion-3</i>
    .
    <p>
      The
      <i>id</i>
      attributes of the accordions are assigned automatically by the plugin, and they are formed by appending the
      <i>ID</i>
      that the accordion has in the admin area to
      <i>grid-accordion-</i>
      .
    </p>
  </p>

  <h2 id="translating-the-plugin">8. Translating the plugin</h2>

  <p>
    There are several tools for translating the plugin's admin text, but I will show you how to do this using
    <a href="http://poedit.net">Poedit</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    First, download and install the software. Open Poedit and go to File -> Open and and select the
    <i>grid-accordion.po</i>
    file, which you can find in
    <i>grid-accordion/languages/</i>
    . Then go to File -> Save As and save the file using a name that corresponds to the language in which you're translating the plugin. For example, if you translate the plugin to German, save the file as "grid-accordion-de_DE"; if you're translating it to French, save the file as "grid-accordion-fr_FR".
  </p>
  <p>
    After you saved the file, you're ready to begin translating the plugin. All you have to do is click on the string that you want to translate, and write the translation for it in the second box, below the English version.
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/translation-poedit.png">
    <img src="assets/images/translation-poedit.png"></a>

  <h2 id="adding-videos">9. Adding videos</h2>

  <p>
    The accordion has built-in support for YouTube, Vimeo, HTML5, VideoJS and Sublime videos. The support consists in the accordion's ability to control the videos automatically (i.e., pause the video when the panel is closed, play the video when the panel is opened, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to these supported video types, you can add any other video, but you will also need to add your own code for implementing the automatic handling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Videos can be added in the
    <i>Layers</i>
    editor, as
    <i>Video Layers</i>
    . This type of layer provide a field where you simply need to put the iframe embed, in the case of YouTube and Vimeo videos, or the HTML code in the case of HTML5 videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>YouTube example:</i>
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/video-layer-youtube.png">
    <img src="assets/images/video-layer-youtube.png"></a>

  <p>
    <i>HTML5 Video example:</i>
  </p>
  <a href="assets/images/video-layer-html5.png">
    <img src="assets/images/video-layer-html5.png"></a>

  <p>
    You might notice that after you save the layers, the code you added is modified a little. This is because the accordion prepares the video for allowing it to be automatically controlled. For this purpose it adds the
    <i>ga-video</i>
    class to the iframe or video tag. Also, it adds the
    <i>enablejsapi=1</i>
    parameter to YouTube videos and the
    <i>api=1</i>
    parameter to Vimeo videos.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the admin area, in accordion's
    <i>Video</i>
    sidebar panel, you can set how the video will react to the opening or closing of panels.

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">10. Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3>1. The accordion doesn't show up on the page</h3>
  <h4>a) JavaScript errors</h4>
  <p>
    First, it's important to check if you have any JavaScript errors on the page that contains the accordion. JavaScript errors thrown by other scripts can break all the JavaScript functionality that follows on that page, including the accordion. I would like to note that
    <i>Grid Accordion</i>
    follows WordPress development best practices and is actively maintained to make sure it's bug free and works seamlessly. However, when something else (another plugin or theme) breaks in the site, it can affect the accordion as well, as mentioned before. Most of the times it's possible to check where the problem comes from, and I will show you 2 methods.
  </p>

  <h5>FIRST METHOD</h5>
  <p>
    Please open Chrome or Safari, and navigate to the page that should contain the accordion. Then, press the F12 key if you're on Windows, and Option + Command + I if you're on Mac. Alternatively, you can right-click and select "Inspect element" on both systems. After the "Developer Tools" is opened please click on the "Console" tab. You will be able to see there all the errors and warnings that occur on the page. Some of them can be ignored but others need to be addressed, especially if they are JavaScript errors.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the left side you will see the error message and on the right side you will see the name/path of the script that contains the error (if the full path of the script is not displayed please hover the text, and the full path should appear). By looking at the path of the script you can identify the theme or plugin that causes the error. If the error comes from another theme or plugin, and not
    <i>Grid Accordion</i>
    , it's best to contact the developer of that theme/plugin, so he can fix the error. If you have difficulties interpreting the data from Console, please try the second method.
  </p>

  <h5>SECOND METHOD</h5>
  <p>
    This method is very simple but normally you would use it only if you can't find the problem using the first method.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you need to do is temporarily deactivate the current theme and then the plugins one by one and test each time if the problem has disappeared. This way you can find which theme/plugin causes the problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you identify the problem as being caused by a theme or another plugin, it's best to contact the developer of that theme/plugin, so he can fix the problem. It's in the best interests of both the developer of the theme/plugin and its user that the theme/plugin doesn't cause errors because a buggy theme/plugin could cause even more problems in the future.
  </p>

  <h4>b) Missing wp_footer() call</h4>
  <p>
    If you don't see any errors in the Console, it's possible that the theme is missing some elements: the wp_head() and wp_footer() calls. These calls are used by many plugins, including this accordion, to insert the necessary scrips in the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wp_head() call should be in the theme's header.php call just above &lt;/head&gt; :
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>

  <p>
    The wp_footer() call should be in the theme's footer.php call just above &lt;/body&gt; :
  </p>

  <pre>
&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

  <h3>2. The admin area doesn't work</h3>
  <p>
    This is most likely caused by JavaScript errors. Please try the debugging methods suggested above for point
    <i>a)</i>
    .
  </p>

  <h3>
    3. The accordion looks different in the page than it looks in the preview
  </h3>
  <p>
    The theme might include CSS code that gets applied to the accordion's elements. For example, if you add a paragraph layer, the style added to paragraphs by the theme, will also get applied to the paragraph layers inside the accordion. The same can happen for heading or image layers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The accordion includes some CSS code that minimizes the influence of external CSS, but it's not always possible to eliminate this influence completely. So, when you see unexpected styles in a published accordion, you will need to add some custom CSS to override the style added by the theme's CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding layers, another solution for preventing CSS influences from the theme would be to use
    <i>DIV</i>
    layers instead of
    <i>Paragraph</i>
    or
    <i>Heading</i>
    layers, since DIV elements are usually not styled by themes. However, my recommendation is to use
    <i>Paragraph</i>
    or
    <i>Heading</i>
    layers every time it's appropriate and simply use custom CSS to prevent theme influences.
