"'Auto' resizes the accordion and all of its elements (e.g., layers, videos) "
"automatically, while 'Custom' resizes only the accordion container and "
"panels, and you are given flexibility over the way inner elements (e.g., "
"layers, videos) will respond to smaller sizes. For example, you could use "
"CSS media queries to define different text sizes or to hide certain elements "
"when the accordion becomes smaller, ensuring that all content remains "
"readable without having to zoom in. It's important to note that, if 'Auto' "
"responsiveness is used, the 'Width' and 'Height' need to be set to fixed "
"values, so that the accordion can calculate correctly how much it needs to "
"scale."
